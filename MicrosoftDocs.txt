***
Host configuration in ASP.NET Core refers to settings that control how the application runs—such as environment variables, logging, and server settings.
ASP.NET Core loads host configuration from different sources in this order:

Environment variables (with the prefix DOTNET_ or ASPNETCORE_).
Command-line arguments (when starting the app).

 The host is responsible for app startup and lifetime management.

***
The Content Root is the base directory where your ASP.NET Core application runs. It is the location where the application looks for configuration files (e.g., appsettings.json), views, static files, and other content.

**
Environment variables are key-value pairs used by the operating system to store configuration settings.

**
While Kestrel itself is a web server, it is often paired with a reverse proxy (like Nginx or IIS) in production to handle additional features like load balancing, security, and more advanced traffic routing.
Kestrel is capable of handling HTTP requests and is commonly used for development and production environments.
It is cross-platform, which means it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

 **
Host Filtering Middleware
It helps restrict which domain names or IP addresses are allowed to access your application. 

Forwarded Headers Middleware
These headers contain information about the original client request, such as the originating IP address or protocol (HTTP/HTTPS).
It’s particularly important for handling requests properly when your app is behind proxies, especially in production environments.

**
IIS Integration in ASP.NET Core refers to the built-in middleware that allows your ASP.NET Core application to run seamlessly within Internet Information Services (IIS), which is a web server on Windows.
Key Benefits:
You don't have to manually configure reverse proxy setups or manage IIS' many features for your app. It's automatically handled.
Leverages IIS' built-in security features like URL filtering, authentication, and logging.

**
a web server is software that serves HTTP requests, meaning it handles incoming requests for web pages, files, or other resources and sends back the appropriate response.
ASP.NET Core Web Server Example:
In an ASP.NET Core application, two key servers are involved in serving the application:

Kestrel: The internal web server that ASP.NET Core applications use by default.
IIS (Internet Information Services): A reverse proxy server on Windows that can handle requests and forward them to Kestrel.
The purpose of IIS integration is to let IIS manage the incoming requests (handling things like security, load balancing, etc.) and then pass the requests to Kestrel, which actually runs the ASP.NET Core application.
Workflow:
Request: A user sends an HTTP request to a website (e.g., http://yourdomain.com).

IIS Handling:

IIS receives this request.
IIS checks if SSL termination is required or if the request is allowed.
IIS passes the request to the Kestrel server (which is running your ASP.NET Core application) through a reverse proxy.
Kestrel:

Kestrel processes the request, runs the application logic, and prepares a response (e.g., a web page, data, etc.).
IIS Response:

Kestrel sends the response back to IIS.
IIS sends the response to the user (browser).

The Generic Host is a more general-purpose host, used for background services, console applications, or applications that do not need to serve HTTP requests

The Web Host is specifically used for web applications. It provides functionality specifically for serving web requests, such as handling HTTP requests and managing web servers like Kestrel (the default web server in ASP.NET Core).
